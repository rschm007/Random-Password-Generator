Upon clicking the button the user is given a series of prompts that help to define the following:

1) How long should your password be?

2) Do you want upper case characters included?
2) Do you want lower case characters included?
2) Do you want special characters included?
2) Do you want numbers included?

If the user enters the wrong range of numbers for the password then they are alerted and returned to the beginning of the prompts. If they don't choose any categories to include then they are alerted and prompted to begin again.

Once the user selects their desired categories, the app randomly generates a password to their specifications and displays the result within the text field. This result is copy + pastable.# Random-Password-Generator
